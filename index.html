        <h2>Section one</h2>
        <p>The website parallax effect has been a preferred trend in website design for nearly a decade. E-commerce
            store owners, bloggers, and marketers are moving towards utilizing this amazing high UX web design feature.
            How about you? Are you considering using parallax scrolling animation or just merely learning about it
            Either way, this post is definitely for you. In this post, I’ll break down the meaning of the parallax
            effect meaning, well-explained examples, types of scrolling parallax effects, brilliant tips for using
            parallax movement on scroll, the good and bads, and highly recommended plugins for parallax scroll
            animation.

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>The website parallax effect is a computer graphics technique in which the website background moves slower
            than the foreground. This leads to a 3D effect as users scroll down the website, creating an optical
            illusion and a more profound and surreal browsing experience.
            The parallax effect works on a principle of optical illusion: As human eyes perceive objects that are close
            to us as more significant than ones farther away, we feel distant objects moving more slowly.

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>This portfolio website by designer and illustrator Ivy Chen is a fantastic example of parallax movement on a
            scroll. Her works are gradually uncovered as you scroll down, as in the gif, thanks to the magic of the
            background parallax effect on the mouse move.
            Ivy’s use of the website parallax effect is highly artistic and highlights and explains the page’s content.
            Being a multidisciplinary designer, she works in both illustration and graphic design and their
            intersection. These two areas are integrated smoothly, with her fashion graphic illustrations gradually
            transforming into photos of real-life garments when we scroll.
